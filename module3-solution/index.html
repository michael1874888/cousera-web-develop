                natural sweetness, then drizzled with a hint of rosemary-infused olive oil for an extra layer of flavor. To
                complete this decadent dining experience, indulge in our signature horseradish cream sauce, which provides a burst
                of tangy and zesty flavors that perfectly complement the rich, succulent beef.

                nigiri, as well as inventive and modern rolls that incorporate crispy tempura, creamy avocado, and succulent eel.

                To enhance the flavors of our sushi and sashimi, we provide traditional accompaniments, such as zesty pickled
                ginger, fiery wasabi, and savory soy sauce. Our Sushi Symphony also includes a refreshing seaweed salad, lightly
                dressed with a tangy sesame vinaigrette, and a steaming bowl of miso soup, which features silken tofu, wakame
                seaweed, and green onions in a savory, umami-rich broth.
